            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Language Used: C++</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 1: Created a simple Hello World program in C++; Used basic linux commands to make copies of files</p> 
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 2: Created programs that focused on the use of conditional loops and statements (such as while, for, if, else if, else, and do while loops/statements), reading in input from the user, and arrays.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 3: Created programs that focused on the use of functions</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 4: Created programs that focused on the use of header files, global variables, multiple namespaces, and recursion. Also created a program that taught the difference between passing in by value, reference, and constant reference.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 5: Created a program that takes arithmetic expressions as input separated by a semicolon, terminated by a character, and parsed into tokens. This program focused on overloading and creating/using structures, classes, vectors, constructors, switch statements and try/catch blocks. This program also focused on exception handling and creating a class profile.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 6: Created programs that focus on writing, reading, creating, and the manipulation of the data of files. Also created programs that focused on the manipulation of user input.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 7: Created programs that focus on virtual, non-virtual, and pure virtual functions as well as access specifiers (public, private, protected), inheritance, C style strings, memory allocation, and overloading operators. Also, created a Singly Linked List program that holds Student structures and then a Sorted Singly Linked List program that holds and sorts Student structures.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 8: Created a program that has a class called Cookie (with variables, enums, getters, setters overloaded operators), an abstract class called Basket that uses the Cookie class by holding all cookies of different types and sizes, a child class to Basket called Basket_Vector which implements all the functions in the Basket class but uses the C++ STL class vector to hold the Cookies, and a child class to Basket called Basket_LinkedList which is just like the Basket_Vector class but instead uses the C++ STL class list to hold the Cookies. This program also reads in cookies from a user input file, puts them into two Basket objects, prints their contents out, prints out the number of cookies of a given type and the total number of Cookies in each Basket uses a third Basket object to be the union of the two other Basket objects, prints out the intersection of these two Basket objects, and prints out the difference of the two Basket objects. This process is done using the Basket_Vector object and then again with the Basket_LinkedList object.</p>

            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Languages used: C++</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 1: This assignment was split into three separate parts that built off each other. The first part's objective was to create a class for the object Stress_ball based on what was included in the header file. In this class, the object has a default and a parameterized constructor, and an overloaded printing operator. The second part's objective was to create the data structure Collection in a class called Collection and have that class hold the Stress_ball objects. This Collection class had both default and parameterized constructor, copy constructor and assignment, move constructor and assignment, destructor, and overloaded operators along with some methods such as insert, contains, remove, is_empty, total_items, print_items, and a sorting function. Finally, the third part's objective was to create a class for a new object called Jeans (very similar to Stress_ball but does have differing characteristics) and a templated Collection class (basically the Collection class but now can work with any kind of object with a set amount of parameters). This templated Collection class will now work like the Collection data structure but will function properly with Jean and Stress_ball objects.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 2: This assignment was split into three separate parts that build off each other. The first part's objective was to implement the Doubly Linked List data structure in a class called DLList that could accept integers. This class included a node structure that could hold data and had next and previous pointers to other nodes in the data structure, the Big Five (copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, move assignment, destructor), constructors, and methods that belong to the data structure. The second part's objective was to implement the Doubly Linked List data structure but to have it templated. It was the same as the program in the first part but just now templated. Finally, the third partâ€™s objective was to take the templated Doubly Linked List program and use it to implement a Minimum Queue data structure. The MinQueue class would use a Doubly Linked List as the list to hold all the data for the Minimum Queue and the class also included methods to make the class reassemble the Minimum Queue data structure.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 3: This assignment's objective was to implement the Binary Search Tree data structure that takes in data to create the nodes for the trees. The assignment also included the Big Five, being able to show off the time it took to search for the node, determining the average search cost for the tree, and the program had to work for perfect, random, and linear binary trees. Some methods include getters for the root and size of the tree, updating the search times, printing the tree inorder traversal, printing the tree level by level, and overloaded operators.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 4: This assignment's objective was to implement the HashTable data structure using a CSV Editor class that also needed to be implemented. After implementing the CSVEditor class which will be able to read from an incomplete CSV file and write to a new CSV file, the data will be put into the HashTable by using the chaining method for hashing. The HashTable class is also able to report the minimum, maximum, and average chain lengths and can search for a specific key in the data structure.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 5: This assignment's objective was to implement a directed acyclic graph data structure. The assignment was split up into two parts with the first part being the implementation of the graph data structure and the second part being the implementation of the topological ordering of the graph. The first part consisted of creating a Vertex structure (which is the Node in this case) that would have an integer label, creating a Graph class that would have a vector of all of the Vertex objects and a vector of linked lists of integer pointers for all of the Vertex objects connecting to a Vertex object. The Graph class also included a constructor, destructor, display, overloaded operator, and build function and took in the information for the Vertex objects through a file. The second part consisted of implementing the topological sorting algorithm for the Graph class. This included creating a vector for the topological order of a graph, printing the topological order of a graph, and the actual algorithm itself.</p>

            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 1: This assignment consisted of building basic elementary logic gates like AND, OR, MUX, DMUX, NOT, XOR, and their bitwise versions. This was done using hardware description language and the only building block that was allowed was the primitive NOR gate.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 2: This assignment consisted of building combinational chips such as a half adder, full adder, 16-bit adder, 16-bit 2's complement, 4-bit Add/Subtract, and an ALU chip. This was done using hardware description language and the logic gates we built in the previous project were used as the building blocks for these chips.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 3: This assignment consisted of building sequential chips such as the 8 16-bit RAM, 64 16-bit RAM, 512 16-bit RAM, 16-bit Program Counter, and a Fibonacci chip. Like the previous project, the language was in HDL and the previous two projects were used as building blocks for this project.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 4: This assignment consisted of building assembly language programs that gave direct and complete control of the machine. Some programs that were created were a division program, a mod program, a greatest common divisor program, and a program called aggie.asm (which would display ATM on the screen when a button was pressed). All these programs told the computer how to do the operation that was asked with very basic low-level commands involving registers in the RAM.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 5: This assignment consisted of building computer architecture chips such as the memory, CPU, and computer. These chips were written in HDL and involved chips built-in Assignments 1-3.</p>
            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Assignment 6: This assignment consisted of building an assembler that converted assembly language program files into binary hack files that a computer could understand. This assignment was programmed in Java and consisted of building a basic assembler and then a full assembler.</p>

            <p style = "color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal"> Final Project: This project's main objective was to create a group creator for the class based on their knowledge in Java and their section. This project consisted of creating multiple programs such as Person, Student, CSCE314Student (the object used for each person), JavaKnowledgeComparator (the program that compared each student's Java knowledge with other students), Utility (read in the CSV file and wrote the team results in a text file), TeamBuilder (used the CSCE314Student, Utility, and JavaKnowledgeComparator programs to form the teams) and Driver which executed TeamBuilder. The final part of the project was creating a GUI that would generate the teams with a click of a button and showed the results and errors found in the program.</p>
