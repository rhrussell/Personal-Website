			<br> <br>
			<!--<p>My name is Ryan Russell, and I am a Junior Computing Major from Texas A&M University. I grew up in a diverse (50% African American, 25% Caucasian, 25% Latinx) town called San Augustine, the oldest Angelo-Saxon settlement in Texas. But more importantly, I am the loudest and the proudest member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2022 and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. Through my time in the band, I have developed into a person who strives for excellence, but also someone who lives out their life with dignity, self-discipline, and enduring pride. Additionally, my experiences with organizations such as the Aggie Coding Club, the Texas A&M Computing Society, and Fish Camp have led me to desire, even more, to become a software developer and use my work to be of service to others. Some things hobbies that I love to do include coding, solving problems, watching movies, and running a movie review blog. After college, my goal is to land a job with a company that encourages its software developers to use their creativity in bettering the world. Be that in solving the problems of the world or its people, creating new opportunities, or to potentially address cultural and other issues across the globe. I want to be a contributing member of my company, its culture, and society in making it a better place every day through my work and that of the company. Another compelling part of my life is that I was raised by parents who are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Growing up with this parental dynamic has led to both interesting dinner conversations and me gaining the ability to understand and appreciate nearly all points of view. I believe this helps me bring people with differing views or opinions and allows me to support them in formulating a consensus.  </p> -->
